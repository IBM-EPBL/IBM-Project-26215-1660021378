PYTHON CODE FOR BLINKING LED:
/*Run the code and youâ€™ll see the LED blink on and off until the button is pressed, at which point it will turn off completely. When the button
is released, it will start blinking again.
  Try adding some parameters to blink to make it blink faster or slower:
  led.blink(2, 2) - 2 seconds on, 2 seconds off
  led.blink(0.5, 0.5) - half a second on, half a second off*/
  
  
from gpiozero import Button,LED
from time import sleep
button = Button(21)
led=LED(25)
while True:
  led.blink()
  button.wait_for_press()
  led.off()
  button.wait_for_release()
  
 PYTHON CODE FOR TRAFFIC LIGHTS:
 
from gpiozero import Button,TrafficLights
from time import sleep
button=Button(21)
lights=TrafficLights(25,8,7)
while True:
  lights.blink()
  button.wait_for_press()
  lights.off()
  button.wait_for_release()


To perform an automated sequence of LEDs being lit:

from gpiozero import TrafficLights
from time import sleep
lights=TrafficLights(25,8,7)
while True:
  lights.green.on()#pin 25
  sleep(1)
  lights.amber.on()#pin 8
  sleep(1)
  lights.red.on()#pin 7
  sleep(1)
  lights.off()
